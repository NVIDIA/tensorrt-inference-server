The test.sh script collects performance results using the trtserver in
this container and then compares it against the results in the
'baseline' directory.


Legacy Comparison
-----------------

The results shown in directory 'legacy_baseline' are for older
versions of trtserver and so may not contain complete results or may
require special handling for comparison.

legacy_baseline/19.04:

  Results from 1.1.0 / 19.04 release. ONNX and PyTorch were not
  available in this release and so are not available. 19.04
  perf_client was used to generate the results and so latencies are
  average and so cannot be compared directly to 'baseline' results
  (which are generated with p95 by default). To compare to this
  baseline need to use PERF_CLIENT_PERCENTILE=0 to generate under-test
  results that stabilize using average latency.

  $ # generate results using average latency to stabilize
  $ # ignore analysis results
  $ PERF_CLIENT_PERCENTILE=0 bash -x test.sh

  $ # Show for min_latency_grpc, repeat for others...
  $ perf_analysis.py --name='Compare to 19.04' --latency --slowdown-threshold=5.0 --speedup-threshold=5.0 --baseline-name=19.04 --baseline=legacy_baseline/19.04/min_latency_grpc --undertest-name=${NVIDIA_TENSORRT_SERVER_VERSION} --undertest=min_latency_grpc
